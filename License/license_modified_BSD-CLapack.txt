1.1) What is CLAPACK?

The CLAPACK library was built using a Fortran to C conversion utility called f2c. The entire Fortran 77 LAPACK library
is run through f2c to obtain C code, and then modified to improve readability. CLAPACK's goal is to provide LAPACK
for someone who does not have access to a Fortran compiler. 

1.2) Are there legal restrictions on the use of CLAPACK software?

CLAPACK is a freely-available software package. It is available from netlib via anonymous ftp
and the World Wide Web. Thus, it can be included in commercial software packages (and has been).
We only ask that proper credit be given to the authors. Namely, we ask that you cite the LAPACK Users' Guide, Third Edition.

Like all software, it is copyrighted. It is not trademarked, but we do ask the following:
