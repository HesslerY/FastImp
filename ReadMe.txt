  FastImp

==================================================================================

FastImp is a wideband impedance extraction program for 3D geometries originally developed at M.I.T. on Unix platform.
It can perform Magneto-Quasi-Static (MQS), Electro-Magneto-Quasi-Static (EMQS) and full-wave analysis
of complicated 3D structures from zero frequency to at least tens of Giga Hertz. 

For pre-compiled binaries, support, consultancy and additional information please visit http://www.fastfieldsolvers.com/
Access to the download pages is free, and you may access anonymously if you want.

The source code is released under MIT license, however FastImp uses also the following libraries, that are covered by
other licenses. In particular, please note that FFTW is distributed under GPL, and this affects also FastImp as a whole.
For the exact license details, please check the information contained with the sources.

How-to-compile instructions
---------------------------

FastImp currently compiles for *nix only.

FastImp has two main components:

-  a wideband surface integral formulation, under the subdirectory "fastImp"

-  a fast integral equation solver, called pfft++, under the subdirectory "pfft++"

You don't need to download and compile the libraries used by FastImp and listed above (FTTW, CLapack, BLAS, SuperLU, TNT)
as separate source packages, but in case your operating system already contains a distribution of that library, which
could be optimized for your hardware, you may be able to use that. This is true, in particular, for the BLAS library.

The main makefile is under the subdirectory "fastImp". It contains the commands to compile the source
code in both fastImp and pfft++. To compile, simply type:

cd fastImp
make

At the end of the compilation, you will find the executable "fastimp" into a sub-directory
under "fastImp/bin". The name of this sub-directory is automatically generated by fastImp/util/config.guess.
This name is a combination of your computer type and the operating system type. For example, 
if you use a desktop x86 PC with Linux as the operating system, this sub-directory would be called ix86-linux.

FastImp was originally developed on Redhat Linux 7.2 with GNU gcc/g++ 2.96 as its compilers and GNU make as its builder.
The present version has been fixed to compile with GNU gcc/g++ 4.1 and GNU make.
